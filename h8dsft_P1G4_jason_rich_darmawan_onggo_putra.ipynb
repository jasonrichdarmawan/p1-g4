    "# Conceptual Problems\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Apakah yang dimaksud dengan `inertia` pada algoritma K-Means ?\n",
    "\n",
    "Inertia, a `sklearn.cluster.KMeans` attribute, is sum of squared distances of samples to their closest cluster center. The formula looks like this `np.sum( ( Euclidean distance point 1 )**2 + ... + ( Euclidean distance point N )**2 )`, euclidean distance is `np.sqrt( x**2 + y**2 )`.\n",
    "\n",
    "In other words, the farther a point is to the center, the higher the inertia is. If we visualize it with a scatter plot, we will see the points to be scattered instead of clusterin near the centroid. Therefore, we can say, the higher the interia, the more variations there are.\n",
    "\n",
    "Therefore, we can use Inertia to determine the best clustering (`sklearn.cluster.KMeans` n_clusters parameter). One way to do this is by visualizing it into line plot (x = number of custers, y = inertia). Simply find the elbow within the plot to find the optimal number of clusters.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Jelaskan yang dimaksud dengan Elbow Method (alasan penggunaan, cara penggunaan, kelemahan/kelebihan, dll) !\n",
    "\n",
    "Elbow method relies on the inertia score. Inertia score explains the total variations within a cluster. In other words, the farther a point to its centroid, the higher the variations is. If do a line plot with the inertia score, we will see an elbow. The elbow tells us that the reduction in variations after the elbow is insignificant.\n",
    "\n",
    "The reason we use Elbow method: We use Elbow method because we want to reduce the variations within each cluster.\n",
    "\n",
    "How to use Elbow method: We can use Elbow method by plotting the `sklearn.cluster.KMeans` inertia_ attribute as the y-axis and the number of clusters as the x-axis.\n",
    "\n",
    "The weakness of Elbow method: It does not take into account whether a point has been assigned to the wrong cluster. In other words, inertia score incudes `np.sum ( Eucledian distance point outlier )**2 `. Therefore, we may deem that the inertia score after the elbow to be insignificant when in fact, there are still points that have been assigned to the wrong cluster (because the decision boundary overlaps with another cluster)\n",
    "\n",
    "The strength: It is easy to interpret if we compared it to the silhouette score visualization. Just one graph and we are good to go. If we use silhouette score, we need to visualize the silhouette score against number of clusters. Then, we need to visualize the silhouette score against the coefficient. Then, we need to compare it between each plot (which is the plot that do not have minus silhouette coefficient (we calculate the silhouette coefficient for each point! Therefore we can know whether a point hve minus silhouette coefficient or not), which is the plot that have cluster roughly the same density, which is the plot that all cluster silhouette coefficient pass the silhouette score).\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Jelaskan perbedaan masing-masing algoritma clustering yang anda gunakan dalam kasus ini !\n",
    "\n",
    "We are going to use KMeans, DBScan and Spectral Clustering.\n",
    "\n",
    "KMeans uses the Eucledian Distance to determine whether a point is part of a cluster or not by calculating the distance of a point to every centroid. Then, the point will be assigned to the cluster with the closest distance.\n",
    "\n",
    "DBScan uses the distance between a point and centroid (we call it as epsilon) and a miinmum samples to determine whether a point is part of a cluster or an outlier.\n",
    "\n",
    "Spectral Clustering uses the kernel function (e.g RBF) to determine the relationship between a point to a point. Then, the algorithm assign that point to a cluster that have strongest relationship with that point."
